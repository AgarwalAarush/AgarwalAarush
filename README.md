### Hey there, I'm Aarush 👋

I'm a student at **Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science**, pursuing a B.S. in Artificial Intelligence & Computer Science. I'm passionate about building intelligent, high-performance systems that operate at scale. My core interests lie in **Deep Learning** and **Agentic AI**, and their applications in full-stack apps.
